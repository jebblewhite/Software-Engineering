    "1 - Append(s): append a string s to the end of the file\n",

    "An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly FIFO basis. People must adopt either the oldest (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue(add in queues), dequeueAny (remove in queues), dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.\n",
